## What is DevOps?

"[DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.[1] DevOps is complementary to Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from the Agile methodology. 

## What is Continuous Integration?

"[Continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) (CI) is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day."

## What is Continuous Delivery?

"[Continuous delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery) is a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released and deployed at any time. It aims at building, testing, and releasing software with greater speed and frequency."

## What is Continuous Deployment?

"[Continuous deployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_deployment) (CD) is a software engineering approach in which software functionalities are delivered frequently through automated deployments. Continuous deployment contrasts with continuous delivery, a similar approach in which software functionalities are also regularly delivered and deemed capable of being deployed but are not deployed."

## What is Infrastructure as Code?

"[Infrastructure as Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools."

## What is Microsoft Azure?

"[Microsoft Azure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Azure) is a cloud computing service operated by Microsoft for application management via Microsoft-managed data centers. It provides software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and supports many different programming languages, tools, and frameworks, including both Microsoft-specific and third-party software and systems."

## What is Github?

"[GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub) is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git, plus its features. It provides access control and collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, continuous integration, and wikis for every project."

## What are Github Actions?

"[Github Actions](https://octopus.com/docs/packaging-applications/build-servers/github-actions) is Github's cloud-based continuous integration server. [Github Actions Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) comprises over 13,000 Actions in one of the largest DevOps ecosystems in the world."

## What is Octopus Deploy? 

"[Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com/) is the worlds leading Deployment Orchestration tool used by over 25,000 companies globally. Octopus has over 500 automation steps built and integrates with hundreds of technologies. You can store your entire project configuration in version control using [Config as Code](https://octopus.com/docs/projects/version-control)"

## What is Octopus Runbooks?
