# Wrap Up

Congratulations on reaching this stage of the workshop, you have successfully completed it!

You have successfully created the following: 

- A GitHub Action workflow that builds a .NET package ready for deployment and ships that package to Octopus Deploy. 
- Deployed Azure Resources using ARM Templates via Octopus Deploy Runbooks
- Create a deployment of a .NET application using Octopus Deploy

This workshop really only scratches the surface of what Octopus Deploy can do but it has hopefully given you some meaningful context you can take into future conversations and engagements. 

If you have any questions, queries or suggestions please either use the [GitHub Discussions Section](https://github.com/TechielassInc/GitHub-Octopus-Workshop/discussions/) or reach out to [Sarah Lean](https://www.linkedin/in/sazlean).
