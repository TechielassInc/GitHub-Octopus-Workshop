# Add a more real world feel to your deployment

The deployment we have set up so far is a simple one, that wouldn't necessarily reflect a production or real world environment. 

The next steps are to make the deployment more realistic. 

## Add a Development Environment

- Head over to **Infrastructure**
- Select **Environments**
- Click **Add Environment**
- Add a new environment called **Development** and **Save**

## Configure the deployment lifecycle

Here we are going set up what Octopus Deploy call a lifecycle.  This is the process in which a deployment is promoted between your environments.  Typically a release would go to your development environment, and then your production environment. 

- Head over to **Library**
- Select **Lifecycles**
- Click on the **Default Lifecycle**
- Click on **Add Phase**
- Type in **Development** for the Phase Name
- Select **Add Environment**
- Select **Development** and ensure **Deploy automatically to this environment as soon as the release enters this phase** is checked and click **OK**
- Click on **Add Phase**
- Type in **Production** for the Phase Name
- Ensure **User will need to manually queue the deployment to this environment** is checked and click **OK**
- Click **Save**

ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ We have set it up so that a deployment goes to Development first and then Production. It is set that any new release that is issued will automatically trigger a deployment to Development, but we still need to manually deploy to Production. ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

## Trigger an automatic release

We want to set it so that any new package that is pushed to Octopus Deploy's package repository triggers a release. 

This is typically what you would see within a real world deployment.  The software engineer makes a change to the code and builds that into a deployment package.  It is automatically pushed to the deployment tool and again automatically deployed to a development environment, for them to either test or the Testing team. 

- Head over to **Projects**
- Select the **Random Quotes** project
- Select **Triggers** under Deployments
- On the screen you will see a section say **Automatic Release Creation** with a **Setup** box below it, click on the **Setup** box
- When the configuration box pops up, select the **Deploy an Azure App Service** step and click **Save**


## Deploy your development environment

We now want to deploy the infrastructure for our development environment. 

- Head over to **Projects**
- Select the **Random Quotes** project
- Click on **Runbooks** under Operations
- Click on **Run** next to the Create Infrastructure runbook
- Select the **Development** environment
- Click on **Run**

## Change the source code

We now want to make a change to our application source code so we can see this new automation happen. 

- Head over to [https://www.github.com](https://www.github.com)
- Open up your application repository
- Navigate to the data folder under **RandomQuotes/wwwroot/data/**
- Open up the **authors.txt** file and click on the pencil icon to edit it
- Enter the text: 

```
Satya Nadella
Barbra Streisand
Rosie O'Donnell
Katherine Johnson
```
- In the Commit Changes box, enter text into the title and description
- Ensure **Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request**
- Give your new branch the name **new-quotes**
- Click on **Commit changes**
- Navigate to the root of your repository
- Switch to the **new-quotes** branch
- Navigate to the data folder under **RandomQuotes/wwwroot/data/**
- Open up the **quotes.txt** file and click on the pencil icon to edit it
- Enter the text: 

```
Culture change means we will do things differently.
Stay true to yourself. People respond to authenticity.
My job is mostly to entertain and be funny.
You lose your curiosity when you stop learning.
```
- In the Commit Changes box, enter text into the title and description
- Select **commit directly to the new-quotes branch**
- Click on **Commit changes**

## Create a pull request
- Select **Pull Requests** within your GitHub repsoitory
- You should see a dialogue box at the top telling you there are new pushes to the **new-quotes**, click on **Compare & Pull request**
- Ensure the pull request is going to merge the **new-quotes** branch into the **main** branch of your repository
- Click on **Create Pull Request**
- Click on **Merge pull request**
- Click on **Confirm merge**

The new quotes are now in the main source code of the application. 

## Check a build is running

You now need to package up the new source code for deployment to your infrastructure. 

- Within your GitHub repository select **Actions**
- Check your .NET workflow is running, if not trigger it manually
