# NDCDevOpsWorkshop Summary

## Summary

The purpose of this repository is to take you through the "DevOps in two days with IaC, Azure, GitHub Actions, and Octopus Deploy" workshop.

This workshop will be led by [Derek Campbell](https://twitter.com/DevOpsDerek) from [Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com/).

Please follow along with the workshop, but we all learn at different paces. If you feel you have completed your task, please read on or look at the [Additional Information](07_Additional_Information.md) and [Wrap up Resources](08_WrapUp_Resources.md).

Class-led instructions are critical to this workshop and may not make sense in isolation.

## Agenda

Join us for a hands-on session learning about core CI/CD concepts and best practices. Review real-world release management and automation problems and discover how to overcome them using Azure, GitHub Actions, and Octopus Deploy.

During the workshop, you use a sample repository. We then walk you through building the application, testing it in GitHub Actions, configuring the release, and passing the artifact to Octopus Deploy for deployment.

You get access to provisioning infrastructure in Azure, building a GitHub Actions workflow, and creating an Octopus Cloud instance. You use these tools to configure and prepare a build. Then you release and deploy a sample application from dev to test to production.

### We'll introduce you to: 

- GitHub and GitHub Actions
- Octopus Cloud
- Microsoft Azure
- Building your .NET 6 multi-tier application using GitHub Actions
- GitHub Actions builder
- Setting up your application to pass packages to Octopus Deploy from GitHub
- Octopus deployments and Config as Code
- Octopus Runbooks
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and how to add infrastructure in Octopus Deploy
- Creating Azure Web Apps & Azure SQL PaaS in Azure via IaC
- Administration of GitHub Actions, Octopus Deploy, and Azure

### If there's time

- Multi-Tenancy, channels, lifecycles, and spaces
- Common deployment patterns including canary, blue/green, and red/black

### Who should attend:

- Developers, Ops, and DevOps Engineers starting on their CI/CD journey
- Software engineers looking for fresh ideas
- Anyone using an older version of Octopus who wants a refresher

### Prerequisites:

- Free Azure or MSDN Subscription with access to create an Azure Service Principal (we advise against a corporate subscription)
- If you are signing up for Azure, you will need a Credit card
